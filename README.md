# ScrollVibe - Scroll to Earn Social Media Platform

Email: testingtesla7@gmail.com 

## Project Description

ScrollVibe is a revolutionary social media platform that rewards users for engaging with content. Built on the Cardano blockchain, it combines the addictive nature of short-form video content with a tokenized economy where users earn $SCROLL tokens simply by scrolling through reels and $VIBE tokens for creating and boosting content.

## Problem We're Solving

Traditional social media platforms extract value from users' attention and data without sharing the profits. Content creators struggle to monetize their work, and users spend countless hours consuming content without any tangible rewards. ScrollVibe solves this by:

- **Rewarding User Engagement**: Users earn $SCROLL tokens for scrolling, liking, commenting, and sharing
- **Creator Monetization**: Content creators earn through tips, boosts, and engagement rewards
- **Decentralized Economy**: Built on Cardano blockchain ensuring transparency and true ownership
- **Sustainable Tokenomics**: Balanced token distribution with staking, governance, and utility features
